# BuildSmart AI Estimator - TODO

## Current Issues & Improvements Needed

### 🔧 Cost Estimation Accuracy
- [ ] **PRIORITY HIGH**: Cost estimates not reflecting current market rates
- [ ] **PRIORITY HIGH**: Quality level changes showing minimal cost differences
- [ ] **PRIORITY HIGH**: Project type changes not generating significant cost variations
- [ ] Enhanced prompt with 2024 market rate guidelines and stronger multipliers
- [ ] Added realistic cost ranges for major markets (India, USA, UAE, UK)

### 📊 Cashflow & Timeline Issues
- [x] **FIXED**: Projected cashflow now matches user's timeline input
- [x] **FIXED**: Added cashflow validation to prevent AI hallucinations
- [x] **FIXED**: Enhanced AI prompt to explicitly require exact timeline months
- [x] **FIXED**: Implemented fallback cashflow generation with proper phase distribution
- [ ] Test cashflow generation with various timeline inputs (3, 6, 12, 18 months)
- [ ] Validate cashflow totals match estimated costs

### 📈 Scenario Comparison Issues
- [x] **FIXED**: Total Estimated Cost now matches Essential Build when user selects Economy quality
- [x] **FIXED**: Scenario comparison now uses base estimate for matching quality level
- [x] **FIXED**: Enhanced fallback logic with proper cost multipliers for different quality levels
- [x] **FIXED**: Improved cost calculation logic to ensure consistency
- [x] **FIXED**: Elite Build now shows 60% higher cost than Comfort Build

### 🌍 Location-Specific AI Insights
- [x] **FIXED**: Risk Analysis and Smart Efficiency Tips now properly generated by AI (up to 8 points each)
- [x] **FIXED**: Added retry logic for AI insight generation with rate limiting
- [x] **FIXED**: Enhanced location-specific fallbacks when AI generation fails
- [x] **FIXED**: Ensured AI-generated content is used instead of generic fallback data
- [x] **RATE LIMIT PROTECTION**: Implemented 30-second intervals between API calls to prevent rate limits
- [x] **HALLUCINATION PREVENTION**: Limited AI responses to maximum 8 points per category to prevent hallucinations
- [x] **TASK QUEUE**: Added sequential processing to avoid concurrent API calls and reduce errors
- [x] **SCENARIO COMPARISON**: AI-powered scenario comparison enabled by default with city-specific analysis
- [x] **RATE LIMIT PROTECTION**: Sequential API calls with timeouts and comprehensive fallbacks
- [x] **REVERT CAPABILITY**: Easy toggle available if AI scenario comparison needs to be disabled
- [ ] **PRIORITY HIGH**: Investigate and resolve API timeout issues causing fallback to hardcoded scenarios
- [ ] Test AI insights generation with various locations
- [ ] Validate location-specific accuracy of generated insights
- [ ] Test scenario comparison AI generation with different quality levels

### 🎯 Model Performance
- [x] Migrated to NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Nano 30B model
- [x] Removed hardcoded fallback values
- [x] All input parameters properly passed to AI
- [x] Debug logging implemented for prompt verification
- [x] Added validation functions to prevent AI hallucinations
- [ ] Test cost generation with enhanced prompts

### 🌍 Global Market Alignment
- [x] Removed hardcoded location data
- [x] Dynamic currency detection by AI
- [x] Free text location input for any city
- [ ] Validate cost estimates against real market data
- [ ] Test with multiple locations and project types

### 🔍 Quality Assurance
- [ ] Test Economy vs Standard vs Premium cost differences
- [ ] Test Residential vs Commercial vs Industrial pricing
- [ ] Verify location-specific cost variations
- [ ] Validate timeline and manpower impact on costs

### 📊 User Experience
- [x] Removed preset form values
- [x] Clean form with empty fields
- [x] Removed hardcoded location dropdown
- [ ] Add cost validation warnings if estimates seem unrealistic

### 🚀 Next Steps
1. Test enhanced prompts with various input combinations
2. Validate cost estimates against market benchmarks
3. Fine-tune multipliers if needed
4. Add cost reasonableness checks
5. Implement user feedback system for cost accuracy
